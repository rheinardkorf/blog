> In 2012 I used this one image in a ultra corny presentation to a group of e-learning professionals. I considered not posting what I did, but hey... its for posterity!

**Rheinard**: Hey.

**Deep Thought**: Hi!

**Rheinard**: Can we ask you a question?

**Deep Thought**: Sure.

**Rheinard**: What is the secret to e-learning?

**Deep Thought**: Let me think about it.

**Rheinard**: How long is this going to take?

**Deep Thought**: Oh, about a 1000 years?

**Rheinard**: We don’t have that much time really. Can we have a short answer?

**Deep Thought**: Sure, but you’re not going to like it…

**Rheinard**: I doubt that. Come on.

**Deep Thought**: 42.

**Rheinard**: What?! Why is that always your answer?

**Deep Thought**: You are asking the wrong question!
