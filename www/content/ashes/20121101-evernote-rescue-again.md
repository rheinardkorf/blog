title: Evernote to the Rescue - Again

I’ve been a long time Evernote (http://evernote.com) user. I’ve now happily had my Premium account for a few years and just love being able to access my notes from anywhere (as well as having offline notebooks on my phone).  

Last week I stumbled upon the MacHeist App bundle for Mac, which included another 15 month of Evernote Premium. Naturally, when the though of subscriptions come up you start to consider your commitment to the ongoing expense. Now I love Evernote and the decision was simple, but it did make me wonder how I was using it.  

A little while ago I stumbled upon a blog post by Fraser Speirs, From OmniFocus to Evernote (external site), where he was looking at using Evernote as a GTD system. I very much admire Fraser and I understand his approach in this post yet I cannot see myself changing my trusted system anytime soon. However, his approach to managing your 30 000 feet areas did resonate with me. Especially since my notebook counts (including stacks) started getting a bit out of control.  

His solution was very simple: “have one notebook stack for each area”.  

I spent a bit of time shuffling things around a bit and I love this approach. Fewer stacks and better tags are helping me get on top of my notes again. I am also using an @ symbol infront of my 30 000ft areas to keep them at the top of the list. Here are my stacks:

* @ Blogging
* @ Conferences
* @ Consulting
* @ Day Job
* @ Personal
* @ Teaching
* Design
* Technology
* Share Culture

So far every kind of note I want to create fits somewhere within one of those stacks. It is no doubt going to change as I expand or shuffle around some of my areas of focus, but for now it seems to be working great.  

Evernote has also recently announced the Evernote 5 Mac app which is looking very promising for managing my notes and stacks even better with the introduction of a few new features – the Grid View especially peaks my curiosity.  

If you have read this far and are still wondering what I am on about, head over to Evernote straight away and get your FREE account. You will not be sorry and I am sure you will find it a great tool to use across all your devices and platforms.  

Being Premium has added benefit, one of which I intend to incorporate into some workflows in the coming year – shared Notebooks. I have some plans for these for helping with work and for facilitating classes with my students. Hopefully I will have some more to share about this soon.  

Again, give Evernote a try, the free account has everything you need to get you going to “Remember Everything”.
