title: Beginning Swiftly
---

So Friday turned out to be quite an exciting day!  PHP 7 released, Lets Encrypt went public beta, but the one I want to focus on, **Swift officially became open source**. I wasn’t too surprised because even at the first release there were rumours and https://swift.org/ already published its vision (which was obvious reading between the lines).

Nevertheless, this is exciting news and I decided that going all in on this means getting your hands on the latest version, which means if you’re on a OSX installing the latest Xcode beta. I was not about to do that and since **Swift is available on linux** I decided to build a Swift vagrant file. This means that you can easily launch virtual machines that you can start coding Swift 2.2 right away.

If you’d like a copy grab it over here, [vagrant-swiftbox](https://github.com/rheinardkorf/vagrant-swiftbox), and then head over to [Swift.org – Getting Started](https://swift.org/getting-started/).

So for the next while as I dive into Swift outside of its normal Xcode habitat I will be documenting my learning here for myself to remember, but also for you to explore.

Happy learning!
