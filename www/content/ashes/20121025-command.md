> People who are especially talented in the Command theme have presence. They can take control of a situation and make decisions.  

Lucky last in my Top 5 Strengths (per Strengths Finder 2.0). Here are they all, one more time: Belief, Ideation, Learning, Connectedness, Command.  

Straight to the point, here are the thoughts that resonate:  

> * Instead of choosing the easy and obvious path, you might challenge yourself to surpass your original goals.
> * Chances are good that you may influence some of your friends to make things happen quickly.
> * You create enthusiasm in others by championing a particular project, rule, process, activity, or idea.
> * You might show people how a daunting task can become a bit more manageable when it is dealt with step by step.
> * Instinctively, you are more comfortable talking about ideas than issuing orders or dealing with conflict.  

These statements are very interesting, especially the first one. It explains why I sometimes overlook easy solutions, something I have been working on very hard! I often need a critical friend to just remind me of the obvious for the sake of keeping things moving. However, this is the characteristic that pushes me to always look at continuous improvement.  

In his book, “The Back of the Napkin”, Dan Roam explains how people can fit into different pen categories: 1) **Black Pen** (the people who jumps at a whiteboard); 2) **Yellow Pen** (the people who highlight what’s there); and 3) **Red Pen** (those who sit back, observe, get over it and draw the next plan of action). In his simple test, I fit into the Red Pen category, which compliments this strength. I am now, however, more keen on grabbing the pen early (or drawing my picture early) – something I’ve been working on since Dan first released his book.  

Contrary to what the title of this strength suggests, I do not like to command people around. Unless of course I see a stale mate situation. 😉
