# Welcome!

My name is **Rheinard Korf** and this is my public "out-brain". 

<!-- I work remotely and Thomas De Moor did a great write up about me and  
[the benefits of working remotely as a parent](https://x-team.com/blog/interview-rheinard-korf/). -->

To avoid a long-winded intro, this is what you'll find out about me on all my public profiles:

```
👤 Christian, Husband, Father, Coder  
📌 Go, JavaScript, GraphQL  
🔖 API dev, Language syntax, Serverless  
💼 Solutions Architect, Software Engineer  
```

<!--Here I write [Posts](/posts/) about things I care about; share some of my learning [Notes](/notes/); and I post [Tips](/tips/) about things I think people should know about. For kicks I also revived some of my legacy posts from the [ashes](/ashes/). -->

Here I will write [Posts](/posts/) about things I care about; I will share some of my learning **Notes**; and I will post **Tips** about things I think people should know about. While I'm getting this sorted out I have revived some of my legacy posts from the [ashes](/ashes/) for kicks.

---------------------------------------------

**The Latest:**

* [Live Stream Learning](/posts/live-stream-learning)  
* [So I am a streamer now](/posts/so-i-am-a-streamer-now)  

---------------------------------------------

**The "Strength Finder" series**

I will revisit these again, but its a good point of reflection for myself and might help you learn more about me:

* [❶ Belief](/ashes/20121021-belief)  
* [❷ Ideation](/ashes/20121022-ideation)  
* [❸ Learning](/ashes/20121023-learning)  
* [❹ Connectedness](/ashes/20121024-connectedness)  
* [❺ Command](/ashes/20121025-command)  

---------------------------------------------
**Remember that time I "rebooted" the blog?**

So in 2010 I did a stupid thing. I erased my previous posts (they were embarassing, so I forgive my younger self). Not all reboots are reflected here, but these I can track.

* [😅2010 - Bye WordPress, Hello Drupal](/ashes/20100619-bye-wordpress-hello-drupal)  
* [💪2012 - Re-Beginnings](/ashes/20121017-re-beginnings)  
* [🍷2013 - Like a fine wine](/ashes/20130301-like-a-fine-wine)  
* [🐆2015 - Beginning Swiftly](/ashes/20151205-beginning-swiftly)  
* [🕵🏻‍♂️2016 - Discovery phase now commencing](/ashes/20170201-commence-discovery-phase)
