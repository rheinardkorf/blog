> The discovery phase is an information-gathering process meant to dig deep into the details of what is important to a client’s business… blah blah blah!

In working with clients we always strive for that perfect client that will allow us adequate time for project discovery. This is because we know that **discovery is such a critical step towards success** of a project. But that is not what this post is about.

Last year I had the good fortune of starting with [XWP](https://xwp.co/) (in fact, exactly 1 year ago today). It has been a tremendous time of regaining my confidence in my skill and learning how to deeply connect with colleagues, clients and friends. The values of the company resonate so well with my own and the fact that they put this to practice is even more inspiring.

On Friday, 6 May 2016, I received an email with this statement: 

> “I’d like to support you in developing your own Growth Plan and beginning its execution.”

Growth plan?! I had no idea what a personal growth plan was. Yet here was an offer to assist me in not only putting one together, but helping me execute it. How could I say “No” to that? It wasn’t easy, but eventually I put a plan together. We had frequent catch ups to talk about it and **inspire each other**.  Towards the end of the year I even reached some goals, like more time praying and finishing a project to extend the house.

This year, however, I realised that I want to try something new. I want to approach my growth plan differently. **If we put so much effort on the discovery phase with our clients, why am I not doing this regarding myself?** It would make goal setting so much easier if I knew a few more things about myself first.

And that is why I’ve rebooted my blog. I am going to learn more about discovery and then applying those techniques towards myself and during this process I will share my findings. Hopefully this will highlight some techniques that will help you on your very own discovery journey.

> Yup. I seem to have habit of reboots. 😅

If you would like to join me, please share your own journey. If you find some good techniques and resources that you think are helpful, I would love to know.

**Go get discovering!**
