> People who are especially talented in the Belief theme have certain core values that are unchanging. Out of these values emerges a defined purpose for their life.

**Background**  

A few years ago a team I worked with engaged in some business coaching. The focus was **strength-based management** that used material from Tom Rath’s book, Strengths Finder 2.0. This presented us with a personal report and action plan to foster our top 5 strengths. This post is about one of them, but here are all 5 in order: Belief, Ideation, Learning, Connectedness and Command.  

If I had no other strengths, I would be glad to have this as my only strength. My personal report highlighted some characteristic that dived even deeper into the believe strength. Here are a few key phrases that stood out to me and these are the ones that I would love to work on some more:  

> * Chances are good that you sometimes need to inform others about the pitfalls and obstacles you see so clearly.  
> * You are naturally compelled to admit the truth.  
> * If someone asked you or told you to intentionally mislead someone, you would reply, “I cannot and I will not do that!”  
> * You probably feel linked with every person and living thing.  
> * You relish differences and would be ill at ease — that is, feel anxious — if forced to remain only in the company of people who are very much like yourself.  

This is by far the strength I value more than anything else, however, because it is so natural to me and so much a part of me it is one that I have not actively sought to cultivate. The report suggest a few ideas to help. As much I would like to share these ideas with you, a good work friend made me watch a brilliant TED Talk by Derek Sivers, titled: Keep your goals to yourself. The idea here is that once you speak or publish your goal for others to see, your mind already draws the same satisfaction from people’s responses as what you get when you actually achieve the goal, thus reducing your chances of doing it. Woah!  

I’ll continue to share my four other strengths with you. The idea is to help you get a better understanding of who I am and why I will be writing the content I am writing. This will serve a few purposes, 1) If you like what I write, I would like you to give me feedback; 2) I get to share the things that are prominent on my mind right now; 3) If you don’t like what I write, that’s ok, there are things that you could be doing/reading that will help you with your goals, right now.
