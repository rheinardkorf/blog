title: Bye WordPress, Hello Drupal
---

Most of the sites I designed over the last couple of years have all been Drupal based. I figured it is time that the same happens for my personal site. I am free-willingly letting go of all my past posts. No archives, no backups. My interests have changed and the new upcoming site will reflect that. Also, the site will look a bit better than this. Looking forward to see what I can do with Fusion sub-theme.
