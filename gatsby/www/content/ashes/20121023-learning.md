> People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

Here is my 3rd of my Top 5 as per Strengths Finder 2.0. here are all of them in order: Belief, Ideation, Learning, Connectedness, Command.  

Digging a bit deeper into my report around ‘Learning’, these are the bits that stand out most to me:  

> * Instinctively, you can finagle — that is, obtain by indirect or involved means — time with people who think about the coming years and decades.
> * You file away lots of ideas and facts, sensing that one day this information will prove to be useful.
> * Driven by your talents, you thirst for new ideas and knowledge.
> * You want to absorb as much information as you can.
> * You desire to understand how things converge.  

Some of these statements hold very true. I love learning new things. These days its often by watching online videos or repeatedly listening to audio books I find interesting. We now have many new platforms that I don’t have to file everything away (though I still do it mentally).  

When I was younger I collected hundreds and thousands of files, books and any electronic media around topics of interest that I could get my hands on (to the point of it being creepy). These all live now in my CD graveyard (cupboard) and its likely that some of these will now be outdated or even irretrievable because of disk-rot, but I just cant get rid of it.  

I also have a few shelves filled with books (mostly non-fiction). My dream when I was younger was to own a house with a large library, keeping books there for when I might need them. Now it’s mostly ebooks living on hard disks (with backups of course!).  

In high school when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up it was usually one of two responses 1) The world’s best programmer; 2) A compulsive student. I opted for the latter and ended up in the education industry. Now its called “life-long learning”, but I still prefer compulsive student. 😉
