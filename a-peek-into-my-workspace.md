![Seems like a nice place.](images/a2eade4610ae3d6d869e9f013c5a4fc4b37811de3684c3c0132f2164293d09de.png)  

Here is where I hang out everyday. I built this in the back of my garage in 2014/2015. I first set foot in it as an office on February 1st, 2015. This was also my very first day of starting work at [XWP](https://xwp.co).

This space has evolved. Things have been added, things removed. Equipment purchased and sold (and there will be more hopefully soon ü§ûüèª). But here is a list of my current gear:

* MacBook Pro 13"
* Mic: Blue Ember XLR
* Audio Interface: Behringer Xenyx Q1002 USB
* Camera: Sony A5100
* Capture Card: No Name USB 2.0 Capture Card
* Headphones: Sony WH-1000XM3
* Keyboard: Keychron K6 Mechanical Keyboard
* Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3
* Key Light: Neewer 480-LED Light
* Fill Light(s): 2x Generic RGB 60W LED Flood Lights (not shown)
* Tablet: iPad Pro 11"
* Extras: Elgato Stream Deck 15keys, Amazon Echo, Various Mounts and Arms üòÖ

And sitting in a shelf until I have power to properly run it:

* Elgato Cam Link 4k
* Elgato HD60+
