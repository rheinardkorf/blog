# Hello, I'm Rheinard.

I am a software engineer and architect working with enterprise solutions. I have been fortunate to work with various languages, deployment stacks and development models.

In this site I will attempt to capture as many of my thoughts, ideas and learnings as I possibly can. My hope is that they may benefit you also.

Built with: [VSCode](), [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Github](#) and [Netlify](#)

## It starts here:

* Building a personal site is hard, but I'm [[overcoming the complexity]]
* I have adopted the no-blog blogging trend by [[building my digital garden]]
---------------------------------------------

**The Latest:**

* [Failing Forwardish in Style](/posts/failing-forwardish)
* [Live Stream Learning](/posts/live-stream-learning)  
* [So I am a streamer now](/posts/so-i-am-a-streamer-now)  

---------------------------------------------

**The "Strength Finder" series**

I will revisit these again, but its a good point of reflection for myself and might help you learn more about me:

1. [[My Top 5 Strengths - Believe]]
2. [[my-top-5-strengths-believe]]

* [❶ Belief](/ashes/20121021-belief)  
* [❷ Ideation](/ashes/20121022-ideation)  
* [❸ Learning](/ashes/20121023-learning)  
* [❹ Connectedness](/ashes/20121024-connectedness)  
* [❺ Command](/ashes/20121025-command)  

---------------------------------------------
**Remember that time I "rebooted" the blog?**

So in 2010 I did a stupid thing. I erased my previous posts (they were embarassing, so I forgive my younger self). Not all reboots are reflected here, but these I can track.
