# Hello, I'm Rheinard.

I am a software engineer and architect working on enterprise solutions. I have been fortunate to work with various languages, deployment stacks and development models.

In this site I will attempt to capture as many of my thoughts, ideas, and learnings as possible. I hope that they may benefit you also.

Let's kick it off:

* Building a personal site is hard, but I'm [[overcoming the complexity]].
* I have adopted the no-blog blogging trend by [[building my digital garden]].
* I have had so many restarts, its time to [[put the past in the behind]].
* The origin story of my strange blood orange logo: [[What does the fox say?]]
* Here are some reasons why I chose [[Foam as my content engine]]
* Lofty ambitions to change an ecosystem while [[building Tide for WordPress]] with Go.
* Been working remote for a few years now (pre-Covid). Here is [[a peek into my workspace]].
<!-- * My notes on [[Building for Web3]]. -->
<!-- * How I started [[building a digital garden with vscode and 11ty]]. -->
<!-- * When the SDK is outdate, maybe you can [[use WordPress as a trusted proxy for an existing API]]. -->
<!-- * [[Developing communication tools for schools]] almost sent me down the gurgler. -->
<!-- * Things would've been so much easier had I known about [[domain-driven development]]. -->
<!-- * If you're not careful you might find yourself [[building an Intranet with WordPress Multisite]]. -->

I also have a list of [[random notes]] for things that don't have a home yet.

[[scratchpad]] of Twitter bookmarked links.

~~I've re-discovered an interest in Go, so checkout my [[Go Development Notes]].~~
