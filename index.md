# Hello, I'm Rheinard.

I am a software engineer and architect working on enterprise solutions. I have been fortunate to work with various languages, deployment stacks and development models.

In this site I will attempt to capture as many of my thoughts, ideas and learnings as I possibly can. My hope is that they may benefit you also.

## Thinking about this site...

* Building a personal site is hard, but I'm [[overcoming the complexity]].
* I have adopted the no-blog blogging trend by [[building my digital garden]].
* I have had so many restarts, its time to [[put the past in the behind]] (aka, live and let die).
* The origin story of my strange blood orange logo: [[What does the fox say?]]
<!-- * How I started [[building a digital garden with vscode and 11ty]]. -->

## Down the technical rabbit hole...

* Lofty ambitions to change an ecosystem while [[building Tide for WordPress]] with Go.
<!-- * When the SDK is outdate, maybe you can [[use WordPress as a trusted proxy for an existing API]]. -->
<!-- * [[Developing communication tools for schools]] almost sent me down the gurgler. -->
<!-- * Things would've been so much easier had I known about [[domain-driven development]]. -->
<!-- * If you're not careful you might find yourself [[building an Intranet with WordPress Multisite]]. -->

## Just another day "at the office" ðŸ¤£

* Been working remote for a few years now (pre-Covid). Here is [[a peek into my workspace]].
