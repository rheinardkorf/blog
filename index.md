# Hello, I'm Rheinard.

I am a software engineer and architect working with enterprise solutions. I have been fortunate to work with various languages, deployment stacks and development models.

In this site I will attempt to capture as many of my thoughts, ideas and learnings as I possibly can. My hope is that they may benefit you also.

### While its fresh

* Building a personal site is hard, but I'm [[overcoming the complexity]]
* I have adopted the no-blog blogging trend by [[building my digital garden]]
* I have had so many restarts, its time to [[put the past in the behind]]. (aka, live and let die)
* How I started [[building a digital garden with vscode and 11ty]]
* The origin story of my strange blood orange logo: [[What does the fox say?]]
