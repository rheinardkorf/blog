I've been sneaking the use of a fox into my name for a while wondering if people will ask about it. You know what? Nobody did! Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!

Often when I introduce myself to people I haven't met I get a lot of puzzled looks. "I'm sorry, what was your name again?" I invariably reply with "[rain-hard], like its raining hard". Which usually gets the "that's unusual". Other times I get this one: "Oh, Like Reynard the Fox!"

So now I am owning it. Yes, I am Rheinard as in Reynard the Fox. My last name is Korf, which is a type of hexagonal basket used during mining eras. It also literally translates to "hive" in Afrikaans (my native tongue).

The original concept looked like the picture below:

I like it, it captures a lot of nice elements pertaining my name. But I found it busy, so I chipped away until only the head remained. I then made it an orange which my wife didn't like too much. Eventually, we all agreed on a more blood orange color.
